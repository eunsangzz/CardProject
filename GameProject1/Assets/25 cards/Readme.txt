[JULY 2021 UPDATE]: Improved 3D models for the metal and stone cards.
Added flags (models and sprites) for the cards, that can be used to add extra information. 
Renamed textures and models so their names are more specific.
Added sprite versions of the textures.
Added two showcase maps (models and sprites)


[MARCH 2018 UPDATE]: Added 3D models for the cards.
Now included into this pack are 3D models of the cards. There are organized in 3 folders:
-Planes: simple 3D planes, the most optimized 3D models. These are one sided (invisible from behind) or 2-sided (2 planes back to back, with a material on each side)
-Cubes: Cubic versions of the cards, with square or rounded corners.
-3D: full 3D cards, optimized for lower polycount.
I also included some versions of the cubic and 3D models with more divisions, that should be useful when deforming the meshes, so they deform properly.
The white and black versions of the cards use a different card back, so there are additional models for those versions.
Each model has a material slot for each side of the card, and there are some planes included for some of the additional details (scrolls, card text, etc).
Finally, there are 2048x2048px textures for each card (that also include their sides), because texture dimensions should always be a power of 2 so the engine can handle them better.



This pack contains the following:
-25 separate 1500x2100 PNG pictures.
-1 multi-layered 1500x2100 PSD file.
-1 multi-layered 3000x4200 PSD file (as a separate file)

The 3000x4200 PSD file is really big (much more than needed for most uses): sometimes Photoshop gave me some memory warnings (with no crashes so far), and it takes a really long time to save it. For that reason, I also included the 1500x2100 version, which should be more manageable and still have more than enough detail.

When I made the cards, I wanted to use medieval man-made materials, to give the cards a fantasy theme while also making the cards simple: wood, gold, silver, bronze, stone...
The design is very simple and clear, without any big ornaments or complex pieces. This way, the cards can be reduced in size and still be easy to recognize the card type, and the card designs don´t draw excessive attention from the text and the illustrations.

If you plan on placing some text on the middle part of the cards (the wooden part on the center of the Wood1 card, for instance), I reccomend using a bold white font with a black outline, so your text can be read easily (especially if you want to use the same text style on all the cards). Personally, I really like how the font Killam looks on these cards. Its a free font that you can find here: http://www.dafont.com/es/killam.font

The card dimensions were chosen so that they fit the ones that some popular trading card games use (such as magic the gathering), so if you want to print them, you will be able to use accessories designed for those games with your game (such as card sleeves or deck boxes). Just make sure that when you print them out their size is 63 by 88mm (or 2.5 by 3.5 inches). The white corners of the cards may also be helpful with the cutting process.

The PSD file has several groups with several layers on it. I reccomend trying playing with the visibility of the layers and find some combinations that you like if you need additional card designs or if you want to try out new combinations. 
Most groups use a layer mask to "cut" the corners of the cards, you can deactivate it by right-clicking on the white box that´s linked to the group and selecting "Disable Layer Mask"; or by selecting Layer>Layer mask>Disable with the group selected.

Here´s an explanation of each of the groups:
-Borders: 
These borders are used to keep some consistency between the cards and give them a rounded look. By default the border is black with rounded corners, but you can also use a complete black outline. 
I also included layers with the rectangle and the white corners I used to cut out the black borders.
-Wood:
Includes a marquee and a background. You can also use the alternate background if you want to use a different design for the text and the picture spaces.
-Black1:
Includes an overlay group for the background. When I made the card originally, the text was hard to read because it was too dark, so I included an overlay group that you can toggle and modify as you wish so the text isn´t obscured.
-Black2: 
This was meant to be the backside of the "black1" card, but it can be used as an independent card as well. You could also use the black1 background if this one is too dark.
-White1 and White2:
Just like the black cards, the white2 card was meant to be the backside of the white1 card.
-Border+Colors:
The first 3 layers of this group are borders (gold, silver, bronze) and the bottom 3 are inner fillings (red, blue and gold). You can combine those to create a big variety of card types (to indicate rarity, faction, price, etc...), and the inner filling layers can be easily modified to add even more colors for more combinations.
-Gold, silver and bronze:
Each of these groups are made of an inner part and an outer part. You can use the same material for both of them, or you can combine an inner part made out of one material with another one made out of another material (bronze and silver, for instance).
-Other:
These layers include some variations of previous cards: a darker and a lighter versions of the silver card, darker wood and darker bronze. These were quite easy to make and I encourage you to modify the cards in similar ways to find new and different materials and colors.
-Scroll big:
This a variation of the wood card with a scroll that fills out the entire card, perfect for adding text or pencil/brush drawings.
-Scroll1, scroll2 and scroll3:
These groups add a small scroll where you can add titles for the cards (such as character names). These can also be moved around so you can place them wherever you want (not justthe top center). 
The only difference between the 3 scrolls is the way they bend: scroll1 bends backwards on the left and right sides, scroll2 bends backwards on its left side and frontwards on its right side, and scroll3 bends frontwards on both the right and the left sides.
-Bronze plate:
This a small bronze plate that I made because I wanted to make one card with gold, silver and bronze parts; but I didnt use it in the end. You may find some use for it.
-Backgrounds:
Wood background1 is the one I have used for most of the cards. If you want to remove the text and picture parts, use Wood back instead.
I also included other backgrounds so that you can play around a bit with them.
